AURALYN: Mood-based Spotify Playlist Generator (because everyone deserves to have their personalized playlists)

anyone who knows me knows my love for music so i had to make a project like this. (i spend hours maintaning my playlists but not eneryone can do that so here you go)

while i learn to handle Spotify Authentication with token exchange for privacy, using Spotify's developer sources, Spotify's APIs to give everyone their very own mood-based playlist. it is an ongoing project. i started off very simple and im trying to increase features to make it more flexible and fulfilling for users.
